Work with me on a high level plan for a change to the codebase. The plan should be high-level with no concrete code.
It should however reference relevant code files for the task at hand,
so that you can pick up easily from the high level plan to later create a low level plan.
Write the plan to the file `plans/$1-high-level.md`.

First ask me what the change is about.
